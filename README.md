## Description
A repositort contained a detailed analysis of tourism activites in Tanzania

Introduction
Tanzania’s tourism sector generated USD 1 billion in revenues in 2020 versus 2.6 billion in 2019, being severely affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on international travel. The sector’s contribution to GDP fell from 107% in 2019 to 5.3% in 2020. International tourist arrivals reached 620,900 in 2020, less than half the 1.5 million arrivals in 2019, the 1.4 million in 2018, and the 1.3 million in 2017.


Problem Statement

In Tanzania, the tourism sector is second in ranking in contributing to the national income. However, during the times of COVID, the industry took a huge blow due to travel restrictions. Now as countries are opening up, Tanzania should expect tourists to come back. The aim of this study is to give insight on the main tourism activity in Tanzania to invest more resources in.

Main Objective
To determine the main tourism activity in Tanzania


Objectives
To identify the countries or regions that contribute the most international tourists
To identify the age groups that contribute the most tourists 
To identify the main tourism activity in Tanzania
To identify the most prefered tour arrangement by most tourists

Research Question
Which country or region of origin contributes the most international tourists?
Which age group contributes the most tourists and what attracts them the most to Tanzania?
Which is the main tourism activity in Tanzania?
What tour arrangement services do most tourists go for?


Hypothesis

H0 Null -The average number of tourists who visit Tanzania for leisure purposes is equal to the number of tourists who visit Tanzania to see wildlife

H1 Alternative(claim) - The average number of tourists who visit Tanzania for leisure purposes is greater than the number of tourists who visit Tanzania to see wildlife.

Business Impact
Our analysis can be used by tours and travel operators and the Ministry of Tourism in Tanzania (Wizara ya Maliasili na Utalii Tanzania) to identify which activities to invest more resources in, to increase revenue from tourism.
